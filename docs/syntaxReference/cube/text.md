### cube

[Import your cube](/cube) into Cogwork Librarian to enable searching for cards in your cube list.
Further filter cube cards by CubeCobra tags using dot notation.
- aliases: `cube`, `list`
- operators: `:` matches any print, `=` matches specific prints in the cube
- valid names: Case-sensitive non-quoted strings. This is the only value that is case-sensitive to be consistent with CubeCobra short ids
- optionally, add a dot (`.`) and a tag string to search for cards in your cube with the given tag

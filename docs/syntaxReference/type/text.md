### types

Use `type` to find cards by type, subtype, or supertype. 

**Note: this currently doesn't track known types, so `t:rat` will find pirates. See the regex example for how to work around this limitation.** 

- aliases: `t`, `type`
- operators: `:`, `=`
- valid input: rawtext, "strings of characters", regular expressions

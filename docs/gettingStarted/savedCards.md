### Saved and ignored cards

Cogwork Librarian stores one saved card list and one ignored card list.
View your saved cards in the search page by clicking "show saved cards".
When you're ready to use your brainstorming list for the next step of your design cycle,
click "copy to clipboard" to copy the saved cards.
Ignored cards are filtered out of all search results.
